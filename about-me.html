                <p class="main-text">
                    I was born and raised in Guangdong, China, where I spent the first 18 years of my life. Even though I focused on science in high school, I was always captivated by design, especially fashion design.
                    That passion led me to take a break from school in my second year and eventually move to Japan after graduating. Japan’s renowned design scene and iconic fashion designers like Rei Kawakubo and Jun Takahashi were major reasons why I chose to study there.<br><br>
                    
                    However, I realized my drawing skills weren't quite up to par, and the cost of design programs was too steep. So, I decided to return to science, and it turned out to be one of the best choices I've made. It opened up a whole new perspective on design and the world around me.<br><br>
                    
                    I've always wanted to explore design through the lenses of math and cognitive science, especially psychology and neuroscience. Initially, I enrolled in an environmental studies program—partly because I've always been passionate about humanitarian issues and environmental protection, and partly because I faced some setbacks during the math program entrance exams.<br><br>
                    
                    During my first year, a conversation with my tutor (who was also my senior) changed everything. I decided to switch majors, and fortunately, I was the only international student that year to successfully transfer. I couldn't have done it without the support of my tutor, professors, and the university staff, and I'm forever grateful for that.<br><br>
                    
                    Now I mainly focus on machine learning research. It's easy to see why—I love how this field seamlessly blends mathematics with cognitive science. My first encounter with this perfect integration was in Prof. Kazuyuki Samejima's Computational Neuroscience course. Since then, I've focused on exploring the foundations and cognition of machine learning, as well as modeling human cognition, yet my fascination with design remains strong and continues to inspire me.
