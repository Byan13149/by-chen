                <p class="main-text">
                    I was born and raised in Guangdong, China, where I spent the first 18 years of my life. Although I studied science in high school, I was always deeply drawn to design, particularly fashion design.
                    That passion led me to take a break from school in my second year and eventually move to Japan after graduating. Japan's renowned design scene and iconic fashion designers like Rei Kawakubo and Jun Takahashi were major reasons why I chose to study there.<br><br>
                    
                    However, I realized my drawing skills weren't quite up to par, and the cost of design programs was too high. So, I decided to return to science, and it turned out to be one of the best choices I've made. It opened up a whole new perspective on design and the world around me.<br><br>
                        
                    Now I mainly focus on machine learning research—a field where mathematics and cognitive science seamlessly intersect. This connection first captivated me during Prof. Kazuyuki Samejima's Computational Neuroscience lecture, where I discovered how computational models could deepen our understanding of human cognition. 
                    This marked the start of my journey into exploring the foundations and cognition of machine learning, as well as modeling human cognition. Although my focus has shifted, my fascination with design remains a constant source of inspiration and continues to shape how I view both research and creativity.
