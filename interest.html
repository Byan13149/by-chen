                <p class="plain-text"><strong>‚û∞ Topology and Geometry</strong></p><br>
                <p class="plain-text">Topology and geometry are both powerful tools commonly used in machine learning research. 
                    Topology studies properties that remain invariant under continuous transformations in topological spaces (such as gluing or loops), while geometry examines properties like distance, shape, and size of a space. 
                    In my view, topology approaches problems in a more global and coarse manner, whereas geometry uses more local and detailed methods.<br><br>
                    Although topology and geometry are closely related in mathematics, they have branched into two separate areas in machine learning research. 
                    Geometry primarily investigates many interesting properties of ML models, such as the Hessian matrix and curvature, while topology is mainly applied in data analysis through a specialized branch called Topological Data Analysis (TDA). 
                    TDA is highly effective in studying the overall structure of data, making it useful for understanding how models process data. 
                    However, the methods used in TDA to compute the topological structures of data are often computationally expensive, which has limited the widespread application and research of TDA. 
                    For more information about TDA, check out Prof. Gunnar Carlsson's work. I also provided a brief introduction in my <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17628" class="link" target="_blank">paper</a>. 
                    I believe that combining these two branches could be an interesting direction, as it would provide a comprehensive perspective on both the local and global properties of data and models.

                <p class="plain-text">
                    Among all movie genres, my top three favorites are sci-fi films like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/" class="link" target="_blank">The Matrix</a>, comedies such as <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808506/" class="link" target="_blank">The Girl Who Leapt Through Time</a>, and historical/biographical films like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4846340/" class="link" target="_blank">Hidden Figures</a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6966692/" class="link" target="_blank">Green Book</a>. I also enjoy most of Marvel's works since many of them incorporate comedic elements (though not all). Additionally, I like to connect movies with real-life reflections. For example, During a film studies lecture, I wrote a final paper analyzing a sociology book and its connection to Japanese society through Japanese films, earning the highest score among over 200 students. <a href='book-review.pdf' class="link" target="_blank">Read more</a>
